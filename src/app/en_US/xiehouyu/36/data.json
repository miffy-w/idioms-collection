  "source": "From Chinese folklore and traditional storytelling. Wang Po (王婆), a legendary figure, was known for enthusiastically praising and advertising her own melons in the market. She would loudly proclaim how sweet and delicious her melons were, regardless of their actual quality. It metaphorically describes someone who shamelessly promotes themselves or their own work, often exaggerating its merits.",
  "meaning": "This idiom teaches us about the nature of self-promotion and the importance of humility. It reminds us that excessive self-praise can appear boastful and may lead others to question the actual quality of what is being promoted. It encourages us to let our work speak for itself and to be modest about our achievements, while also acknowledging that some degree of self-promotion is necessary in certain contexts.",
  "usage": "Use this idiom when someone is excessively praising themselves or their own work, or when describing a situation of shameless self-promotion. For example, a job applicant exaggerating their qualifications, a company promoting its products with exaggerated claims, or someone bragging about their own achievements.",
  "imgPrompt": "A stylized illustration blending traditional Chinese watercolor and modern minimalism. On one side, depict a cheerful, stylized old woman (Wang Po) in simple historical clothing, proudly presenting a pile of ripe, glossy melons at a market stall. On the other side, use visual metaphors for self-praise: perhaps an exaggerated speech bubble containing shining melon icons, or the woman's reflection in a melon appearing boastful. Use warm, harmonious colors like melon-green, soft orange, and earthy tones. Incorporate subtle cultural elements like faint bamboo silhouettes or ink wash textures in the background. The composition is clean, balanced with ample negative space, suitable for a card layout. The style is artistic, detailed, and professional, with a 1:1 aspect ratio.",
