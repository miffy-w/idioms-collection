  "source": "This idiom originates from Chinese folk sayings. In ancient times, people would ride donkeys while reading opera scripts or storybooks as they traveled. The phrase '走着瞧' literally means 'look while walking' - you're going to see what happens as you proceed on your journey. It metaphorically describes a situation where one should wait and see the outcome rather than jumping to conclusions.",
  "meaning": "This idiom teaches us about patience and the importance of letting events unfold naturally. It reminds us that making premature judgments can be unwise, and that the truth will reveal itself over time. It encourages a calm, confident attitude when facing uncertainty, knowing that the outcome will become clear eventually.",
  "usage": "Use this idiom when expressing confidence that time will prove who is right, or when telling someone to wait and see the results rather than arguing. For example, when someone doubts your abilities, you might say this to express that your results will speak for themselves, or when the outcome of a situation is uncertain.",
  "imgPrompt": "A serene traditional Chinese watercolor scene blended with modern minimalism. A figure in simple historical attire rides a gentle donkey on a winding path, calmly reading an open booklet (libretto). The path extends into the distance, symbolizing the journey and the future. Subtle ink-wash strokes and faint bamboo silhouettes grace the background. The composition is balanced with ample negative space, using warm, harmonious tones like muted earth browns, soft greens, and gentle blues. The overall aesthetic evokes patience, observation, and cultural elegance, suitable for a clean card layout with text overlay. High-quality, detailed, artistic, professional illustration, 1:1 ratio.",
