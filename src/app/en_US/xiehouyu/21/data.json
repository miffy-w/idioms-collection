  "source": "From Tang dynasty Liu Zongyuan's \"Preface to the Poems by the Wang Brothers.\" Ban refers to Lu Ban, the master carpenter of the Spring and Autumn period, revered as the ancestor of carpentry. Showing off axe skills at Lu Ban's door metaphorically describes showing off in front of an expert and overestimating oneself.",
  "meaning": "This idiom teaches humility and self-awareness. It reminds us to recognize the limits of our knowledge and skills, especially in the presence of true masters. It cautions against arrogance and encourages us to learn from those with greater expertise rather than foolishly trying to impress them.",
  "usage": "Use this idiom when someone attempts to show off their limited skills in front of experts, or when a beginner tries to teach someone who is already highly experienced. For example, an amateur cook giving advice to a professional chef, or a new employee suggesting improvements to a veteran colleague who has worked there for decades."
