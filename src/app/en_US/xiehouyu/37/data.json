  "source": "This idiom originates from ancient Chinese bureaucracy. When a new official took office, they would often start by implementing bold reforms and decisive actions to establish their authority and demonstrate their competence. The 'three fires' represent these initial energetic efforts. It metaphorically describes the enthusiasm and bold initiatives that new leaders often bring when they first assume their positions.",
  "meaning": "This idiom teaches us about the psychology of new leadership and the importance of making a strong first impression. It reminds us that new leaders often bring fresh energy and ideas, but also that this initial enthusiasm may fade over time. It encourages new leaders to make meaningful changes while being aware that sustained effort is needed for long-term success.",
  "usage": "Use this idiom when describing a new leader making bold changes in their first days, or when predicting that someone's initial enthusiasm may not last. For example, a new manager implementing sweeping policy changes, a new CEO announcing ambitious initiatives, or a new teacher starting with strict rules that might later relax.",
  "imgPrompt": "A stylized illustration blending traditional Chinese watercolor and modern minimalism. On one side, depict a cheerful, stylized old woman (Wang Po) in simple historical clothing, proudly presenting a pile of ripe, glossy melons at a market stall. On the other side, use visual metaphors for self-praise: perhaps an exaggerated speech bubble containing shining melon icons, or the woman's reflection in a melon appearing boastful. Use warm, harmonious colors like melon-green, soft orange, and earthy tones. Incorporate subtle cultural elements like faint bamboo silhouettes or ink wash textures in the background. The composition is clean, balanced with ample negative space, suitable for a card layout. The style is artistic, detailed, and professional, with a 1:1 aspect ratio.",
