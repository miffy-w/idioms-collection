  "source": "This idiom originates from Chinese proverbs. A tiger is powerful and feared in the mountains, but when it descends to flat lands (平阳 - Pingyang, meaning flat terrain), it loses its natural advantage and can even be bullied by dogs. It metaphorically describes powerful people who, when out of their favorable environment, become vulnerable and can be oppressed by those they would normally dominate.",
  "meaning": "This idiom teaches us about the importance of environment and context in determining one's power and influence. It reminds us that strength is relative and depends on being in the right circumstances. It also serves as a warning to powerful people to be humble and recognize their vulnerability when outside their domain.",
  "usage": "Use this idiom when a powerful person is in a difficult situation where they lose their advantage and are oppressed by those they would normally dominate, or when warning against the consequences of losing one's advantageous position. For example, a CEO losing power and being mistreated by subordinates, or a military general defeated and captured by ordinary soldiers."
