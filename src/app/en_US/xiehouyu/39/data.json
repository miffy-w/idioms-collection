  "source": "This Chinese two-part allegorical saying, known as a xiehouyu, has its origins in the daily life of ancient China. The phrase vividly describes the literal action of using multiple buckets on a single rope or pulley system to draw water from a deep well. Historically, wells were crucial water sources, and drawing water was a common chore. The imagery of fifteen buckets specifically creates a scene of busy, chaotic, and repetitive motion. Over time, this concrete scene evolved into a metaphorical expression. While no single famous historical event or figure is directly tied to its creation, it emerged from collective folk wisdom, capturing a universal human sensation through a relatable, tangible scenario.",
  "meaning": "This idiom is used to describe a state of emotional turmoil, anxiety, or nervousness, where one's heart or mind feels unsettled and restless. The core idea is the feeling of being pulled in different directions simultaneously, just like the buckets going up and down erratically. It perfectly captures the sensation of inner conflict, worry before a significant event, or general unease when facing uncertainty. The 'seven up, eight down' part is not meant to be mathematically precise but emphasizes disorder and lack of peace.",
  "usage": "Use this idiom in informal spoken or written contexts to describe feelings of nervousness, anxiety, or being emotionally unsettled. It's commonly applied when someone is waiting for important news, before a test or job interview, after making a difficult decision, or in any situation causing inner turmoil. The tone is descriptive and slightly vivid, not harsh. It helps convey a shared understanding of a common human experience. For example: 'Waiting for the exam results has me feeling like fifteen buckets drawing water from a well—seven up, eight down.'",
