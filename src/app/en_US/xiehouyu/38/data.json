  "source": "This proverb originates from ancient Chinese folklore and literature, reflecting a common observation in nature. The toad, often considered lowly and unattractive in traditional Chinese culture, is contrasted with the swan, a symbol of purity, beauty, and nobility. The phrase vividly captures the absurdity of an impossible desire. It has been used in classic novels, such as 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' to describe characters harboring unrealistic ambitions beyond their social station or capabilities. The imagery is straightforward yet powerful, making it a enduring metaphor in Chinese language.",
  "meaning": "This idiom describes someone who has unrealistic or wildly ambitious dreams that are completely out of reach. It criticizes foolish overconfidence or desire for something one is utterly unqualified or unsuited to obtain. The core idea is about the futility and absurdity of chasing impossible goals, emphasizing a mismatch between desire and reality.",
  "usage": "Use this phrase to humorously or critically point out that someone's goal or wish is utterly impractical and bound to fail. It carries a tone of mild mockery or gentle admonishment, often applied in casual conversations about unrealistic ambitions in career, love, or personal achievements. It's suitable among friends, in storytelling, or in instructive contexts to highlight a lesson about knowing one's limits.",
