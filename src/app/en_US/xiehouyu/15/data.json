  "source": "Comes from \"Strategies of the Warring States: Qi Strategy II.\" A man from Chu rewarded guests with wine after sacrificing to ancestors. The guests decided to compete in drawing snakes - the first to finish would drink the wine. One man drew quickly, picked up the wine pot to drink, then added feet to his snake. Another man finished his snake, took the wine, and said: \"Snakes have no feet; by adding feet, it is no longer a snake.\" It metaphorically describes doing something unnecessary and ruining the result.",
  "meaning": "This idiom cautions against perfectionism that becomes counterproductive. It teaches us that knowing when to stop is as important as knowing what to do. Adding unnecessary elements to something already complete can only diminish its value. It emphasizes the wisdom of restraint and simplicity.",
  "usage": "Use this idiom when someone adds unnecessary details or features that actually make things worse or more complicated. For example, adding too many special effects to a movie that distract from the story, or over-decorating a beautiful design until it becomes cluttered and loses its appeal."
