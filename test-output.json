    "source": "This idiom originates from the daily life of ancient Chinese people who used buckets tied to ropes to draw water from wells. When multiple buckets are lowered and raised simultaneously, they move up and down in a disorderly manner, creating a chaotic visual effect. The phrase 'seven up, eight down' vividly captures this image of imbalance and unrest. Over time, it evolved into a metaphorical expression to describe a person's inner turmoil, reflecting the Chinese cultural tradition of using concrete imagery from nature and daily life to convey abstract emotional states. The idiom does not have a specific literary source but is widely used in folk language and classical literature, such as in the novel 'Water Margin' (《水浒传》), where similar imagery appears to depict characters' psychological states.",
    "meaning": "This idiom describes a state of extreme anxiety, nervousness, or indecision, where one's mind is in disarray, like the buckets moving up and down unpredictably. It conveys the cultural value of emotional restraint and the importance of maintaining inner peace in Chinese philosophy, particularly in Confucianism and Taoism, which emphasize harmony and balance. The idiom teaches that uncontrolled emotions can lead to mental chaos, and it encourages self-awareness and emotional regulation. It is often used to highlight the wisdom of staying calm under pressure, reflecting the traditional Chinese belief that a stable mind is essential for making wise decisions and navigating life's challenges.",
    "usage": "This idiom is commonly used in both spoken and written Chinese to describe situations involving anxiety or uncertainty. For example, before taking an important exam, a student might say, 'My heart feels like fifteen buckets drawing water—seven up and eight down,' to express their nervousness. In a business context, a manager facing a critical decision might use it to describe their inner conflict, such as, 'During the merger negotiations, I was like fifteen buckets in a well, feeling completely unsettled.' It can also be applied in storytelling or literature to depict characters' psychological struggles, adding depth to their emotional experiences.",
