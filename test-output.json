    "source": "This saying originates from a popular Chinese folk story. 'Old Woman Wang' is not a specific historical figure but a common archetype representing a street vendor. The phrase vividly depicts a melon seller enthusiastically praising her own goods to attract customers. Over time, it evolved into a fixed two-part allegorical saying (Xiehouyu), where the first part sets the scene and the second reveals the meaning. It reflects the traditional marketplace culture where self-promotion was essential for business, yet also carried a hint of skepticism from buyers who might doubt such boasts. The saying has been passed down orally and appears in various collections of folk wisdom.",
    "meaning": "This idiom criticizes the act of excessively praising oneself or one's own products, often implying that the praise may be exaggerated, biased, or lacking objectivity. It carries a cultural connotation of modesty, suggesting that true value should be recognized by others rather than proclaimed by oneself. The educational wisdom warns against blind self-promotion and encourages humility, discernment, and letting one's actions or work speak for themselves. It is commonly used to gently mock or advise someone who is boasting.",
    "usage": "This idiom is often used in informal or semi-formal contexts to critique obvious self-promotion. For example, when a colleague repeatedly highlights their minor contribution in a team meeting, others might whisper, 'He's really like Old Woman Wang selling melons.' In a business context, if an advertisement makes unrealistic claims about a product, a skeptical consumer might comment, 'This is just self-praise, like Wang selling her melons.' It serves as a humorous yet pointed reminder to be modest.",
    "imgPrompt": "A stylized illustration blending traditional Chinese watercolor and modern minimalism. On one side, depict a cheerful, stylized old woman (Wang Po) in simple historical clothing, proudly presenting a pile of ripe, glossy melons at a market stall. On the other side, use visual metaphors for self-praise: perhaps an exaggerated speech bubble containing shining melon icons, or the woman's reflection in a melon appearing boastful. Use warm, harmonious colors like melon-green, soft orange, and earthy tones. Incorporate subtle cultural elements like faint bamboo silhouettes or ink wash textures in the background. The composition is clean, balanced with ample negative space, suitable for a card layout. The style is artistic, detailed, and professional, with a 1:1 aspect ratio.",
